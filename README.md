# 🛒 Retail Sales Forecasting using LSTM

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting future product sales for better inventory and supply chain management using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks. Accurate sales forecasting helps businesses optimize stock levels, reduce wastage, and meet customer demand more effectively. The project also includes an automated alert system that notifies when predicted sales may exceed stock thresholds.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Retail stores often face challenges in balancing supply and demand due to:
- Unpredictable customer purchasing behavior
- Seasonal trends and promotional spikes
- Risk of overstocking or stockouts

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict daily sales based on historical patterns, enabling proactive stock management.

## 💾 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Store Sales Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data)
- **Main File Used:** `train.csv`
- **Key Columns:**
  - `date` — Date of transaction
  - `store_nbr` — Store number
  - `family` — Product category
  - `sales` — Sales value
  - `onpromotion` — Promotion indicator

For this project, the data is preprocessed by filtering for a specific store and product category, then aggregated to daily sales.

## 🔑 Why LSTM?

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are ideal for time series forecasting because they:
- Capture long-term dependencies in sequential data
- Handle seasonality, trends, and sudden changes in sales
- Outperform traditional statistical models like ARIMA in complex datasets
